# 🎯 PRISM Protocol - Pitch Deck
---
## Slide 1: Title
# PRISM Protocol
### Zero-Knowledge Proof of Humanity
*Physics vs. AI — The Only Fight AI Cannot Win*
---
## Slide 2: The Problem
# 🚨 The Collapse of Trust
- **50M+ deepfake videos** online (2024)
- Video verification is **dead**
- Bots control **20% of social media**
- DAOs lose **$100M+/year** to Sybil attacks
> *"If you can't prove you're human, you don't exist online."*
---
## Slide 3: Current Solutions Fail
| Solution | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **WorldCoin** | $300K hardware, privacy concerns |
| **CAPTCHA** | Solved by AI in <1 second |
| **AI Detectors** | Losing the arms race |
| **KYC** | Privacy invasive, centralized |
**We need a new approach.**
---
## Slide 4: Our Insight
# 💡 Physics vs. AI
AI lives in **pixel space**.
Humans live in **physics space**.
We don't ask: *"Does this look real?"*
We ask: *"Does this obey physics?"*
**AI cannot fake the laws of physics.**

## Slide 5: How It Works
# 🔮 The PRISM Verification
```
1. Chroma Challenge
   Screen flashes colors onto face
           ↓
2. Physics Analysis
   Corneal reflections, skin scattering
           ↓
3. Biology Detection
   Heart rate from face (no touch!)
           ↓
4. Zero-Knowledge Proof
   Prove "human" without revealing face
           ↓
5. Soulbound Token
   On-chain proof in your wallet
```
**10 seconds. Any webcam. Total privacy.**
---
## Slide 6: The Tech Stack
| Layer | Innovation |
|-------|------------|
| **Physics** | Corneal reflection, subsurface scattering |
| **Biology** | VidFormer rPPG (±1.34 BPM accuracy) |
| **Privacy** | EZKL zero-knowledge proofs |
| **Identity** | Soulbound tokens (ERC-5192) |
*5 layers of verification. 0 data stored.*
---
## Slide 7: Why We Win
| Feature | WorldCoin | Humanity | **PRISM** |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Hardware | $300K Orb | Palm Scanner | **Webcam** |
| Privacy | Iris stored | Palm stored | **Nothing stored** |
| Physics-based | ❌ | ❌ | **✅** |
| Heart detection | ❌ | ❌ | **✅** |
| Scaling | Slow | Medium | **Instant** |
